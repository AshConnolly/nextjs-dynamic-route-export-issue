# Dynamic routes and export static not working

I have a site that is statically exported, and has dynamic routes.

Inside the dynamic routes Iâ€™m grabbing the router.query.id value, and doing client side fetching with it (I'm using client side fetching as the app is exported to static files).

Taking the [next.js static example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-static-export) as a starting point, I've edited `pages/post/[id].tsx` file by removing the `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (as I donâ€™t require build time static generation) and I've added clientside fetching on mount:

```tsx
import Head from 'next/head'
import Link from 'next/link'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { GetPost } from '../../lib/postdata_api'
import { PostData } from '../../types/postdata'

const Post = () => {
  const [postData, setPostData] = useState<null | PostData>(null)
  const router = useRouter()
  const id = router.query.id as string

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!router.isReady) return
    GetPost(id).then(r => setPostData(r))
  }, [router.isReady, id])

  if (!postData) return 'Loading...'

  return (
    <main>
      <Head>
        <title>{postData.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <h1>{postData.title}</h1>

      <p>{postData.body}</p>

      <Link href="/">
        <a>Go back to home</a>
      </Link>
    </main>
  )
}

export default Post
```

Now this will work fine if I run it in dev mode.

However if I build & export it, and then [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) the static files it doesnâ€™t work.

You can go to the site root and click on a link, which will take you to a post page like [`http://localhost:3000/post/1`](http://localhost:3000/post/1) but if you refresh the page / visit it directly, it does not work.

**Why is this? Do dynamic routes, that need to access the router query object, not work when statically exported?**

# Static export example

This example show how to export to static HTML files your Next.js application fetching data from an API to generate a dynamic list of pages.

When trying to run `npm start` it will build and export your pages into the `out` folder and serve them on `localhost:5000`.
